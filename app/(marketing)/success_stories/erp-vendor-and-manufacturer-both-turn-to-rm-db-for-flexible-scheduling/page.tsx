                                User Solutions has announced another successful manufacturing
                                scheduling application for Plastilite. Plastilite Corporation,
                                located in Omaha Nebraska, provides insulated and protective
                                packing solutions to companies shipping perishable and fragile
                                products across the United States. Their containers are now
                                routinely used in transporting everything from Omaha Steaks to
                                pies to vaccines and even biological materials, and the list of
                                uses keeps growing.

                                In order to continue their growth and improve manufacturing
                                competitiveness, Plastilite decided to implement a new ERP
                                System this year. Part of Plastilite's requirements was to
                                improve their manual planning and scheduling system which, up to
                                that point, was basically one person's hands-on experience of
                                running operations.

                                Fourth Shift, an ERP system from Softbrands, Inc., was the
                                frontrunner for addressing most of their accounting and
                                inventory needs, however the scheduling module was not flexible
                                or advanced enough to manage the complexities of Plastitlite's
                                scheduling needs.

                                According to Jon Ehly, Plastilite Chief Financial Officer,
                                Fourth Shift recommended Resource Manager-DB from User
                                Solutions, Inc. as an add-on for Fourth Shift to handle the
                                advanced production planning and scheduling requirements. The
                                combination of many injection molding machines, and with each
                                machine different tool configurations to manage holding
                                different combinations of molds for a variety of products was
                                far too complex for ERP's basic infinite capacity scheduling
                                system.

                                    Implementation months ago then called User Solutions to come
                                    on site to help us with the scheduling module. They arrived on
                                    Monday and by Friday we had a complete optimized schedule
                                    generated with full integration with our ERP System."

                                Jon concludes, "It was refreshing to work with a vendor who
                                absolutely delivered on their promise. Initially, they expected
                                to have a prototype of the process implemented in one week.
                                Instead, they were able to fully load the schedule and integrate
                                with our ERP system – all in one week. We strongly recommend for
                                other manufacturing companies, who are struggling with manual
                                scheduling techniques, to give User Solutions and Resource
                                Manager-DB a try."
