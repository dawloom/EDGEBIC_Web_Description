                                Joe Van Wagner, Production Manager for Cummins Engine, selected
                                a Resource Manager to assist in scheduling labor and machine
                                resources. "We are in the midst of changing our corporate system
                                and neither (old or new) system will handle job shop management
                                the way we run our shops." We need a flexible tool for planning
                                and scheduling labor over several months. In addition, we need
                                to schedule day-to-day machine operations per the master
                                schedule. Resource Manager for Excel is the perfect fit for a
                                stop-gap solution for these areas."

                                Cummins Engine has 33 locations around the U.S. and accessorizes
                                engines for custom applications. According to Mr. Van Wagner,
                                "We like the fact that Resource Manager for Excel has a
                                Bill-Of-Resource that can include the tool, labor, and machine
                                requirements for scheduling the shop. With our old legacy system
                                from Xerox, we had only basic parts and engine model information
                                for scheduling; now we have detailed man-hours and routings
                                available. We like the ability, with Resource Manager for Excel,
                                to define load and select a realistic promise date for our
                                customers â€” we have already seen an increase in customer
                                satisfaction."

                                Joe continues, "The flexibility of the product is pretty
                                fantastic. We are able to download our Bills-Of-Materials from
                                the AS400 directly into Resource Manager for Excel, add labor
                                and routings, and immediately generate master schedules. In
                                addition to master scheduling, we make parts for engines and
                                distribution and can use Resource Manager to schedule production
                                in this make-to-stock application. The neat graphing capability
                                gives us an excellent visual on what is happening, or needs to
                                happen."
