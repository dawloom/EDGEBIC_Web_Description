                                    The purpose of the EOQ model is simple, to find that
                                    particular quantity to order which minimizes the total
                                    variable costs of inventory. Total variable costs are usually
                                    computed on an annual basis and include two components, the
                                    costs of ordering and holding inventory. Annual ordering cost
                                    is the number of orders placed times the marginal or
                                    incremental cost incurred per order. This incremental cost
                                    includes several components: the costs of preparing the
                                    purchase order, paying the vendor's invoice, and inspecting
                                    and handling the material when it arrives. It is difficult to
                                    estimate these components precisely but a ball-park figure is
                                    good enough. The EOQ is not especially sensitive to errors in
                                    inputs.

                                    Why don't we include the purchase cost of the inventory in
                                    this calculation? It is not a variable cost. We have to
                                    purchase the inventory in any event. The goal is to minimize
                                    those costs that vary with the quantity purchased at one time.
