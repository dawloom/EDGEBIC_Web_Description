                                BAE Systems/Ordinance Systems Inc. set out to design and
                                implement a process that would enable our manufacturing
                                personnel to systematically identify process, equipment, labor,
                                and material limitations when responding to customer order
                                delivery inquiries. We had already purchased and implemented an
                                ERP system (with Material Requirements Planning and Capacity
                                Requirements Planning functionality), but we weren't satisfied
                                with its ability to recognize our capacity constraints or meet
                                our finite scheduling needs. The MRP product allowed us to enter
                                a Master Scheduler that exceeded available capacity and offered
                                little visibility when we did so. Consequently, we chose to
                                discontinue its use for production planning activities.
