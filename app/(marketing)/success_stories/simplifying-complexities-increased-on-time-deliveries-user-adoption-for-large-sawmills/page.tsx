                                We have been using the RMDB scheduling software, increasingly,
                                for the last year. I say increasingly because there was a lot of
                                reluctance to using it first. The reluctance came because there
                                was the idea that even though plywood production is "Old
                                Technology" manufacturing, the intricacies of the different
                                species and manners to deconstruct a log into various sizes of
                                veneer and the reassemble it into plywood was too difficult to
                                schedule. This has been proven incorrect by your software and a
                                lot of hard work in implementing it both by you and our staff.
                                It has allowed us to:
