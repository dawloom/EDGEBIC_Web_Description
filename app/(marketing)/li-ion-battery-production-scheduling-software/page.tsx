                                        In 2015, Enevate Corporation, a developer of next-generation
                                        Li-ion batteries, built a new manufacturing facility. They
                                        needed more than traditional ERP functions like costed
                                        bills-of-materials, inventory control, MRP, and lot
                                        traceability. The system also had to handle finite capacity
                                        scheduling and advanced routings—while staying adaptable.

                                        Scott Bennett, Supply Chain Manager for Enevate, says,
                                        &quot;The User Solutions team and Resource Manager-DB gave
                                        us the unique combination we needed, without losing
                                        flexibility, at a reasonable cost.&quot;
                                    </p>

                                        Because Enevate was building new and original processes for
                                        innovative batteries, they needed dynamic supply chain
                                        reconfiguration. Resource Manager-DB&apos;s flexible format
                                        allowed them to combine workcenters, products, and
                                        sub-assemblies to test a wide range of &quot;what-if&quot;
                                        scenarios. They could create models in minutes or import
                                        different scenarios. Excel integration made managing data
                                        sets simple and quick.
                                    </p>

                                        Scott adds, &quot;The product adapts easily to our business
                                        needs. User Solutions also customizes features to match our
                                        requests. We have used deep sub-assembly structures,
                                        imported new configurations via Excel, and scheduled
                                        workcenters and products in almost any combination. We keep
                                        finding new ways to benefit from the tool.&quot;

                                        User Solutions also enhanced their Lot Management capability

                                        location and lot. They even combined Workcenters (for
