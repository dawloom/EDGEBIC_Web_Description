                ACE Controls, Inc., located in Farmington MI, had a requirement
                to improve their current system, to immediately implement a
                solution for the day-to-day scheduling challenges of the machine
                shop. Supported by the NIST/Michigan Manufacturing Technology
                Center, Resource Manager was selected both for its benefit/cost
                ratio and for compatibility on the company's existing Excel
                platform, already used to communicate manufacturing reports.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                According to Dave Teumer, Buyer and Scheduling Manager, "What I
                especially like about the Resource Manager is that is was simple
                to get installed and up and running. We have improved our
                on-time delivery by being able to view the impact of different
                production schedules and workcenter loading. The product is so
                flexible and adaptable, it is quite easy to model different
                scenarios to determine if a certain method or schedule can
                actually benefit our bottom line."
