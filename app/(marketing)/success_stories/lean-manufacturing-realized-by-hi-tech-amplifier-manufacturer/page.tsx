                                Amplifiers (both pulsed and CW). IFI equipment is used

                                leading supplier of high power transmitters.

                                IFI has implemented Resource Manager-DB to support a transition
                                to LEAN Manufacturing methods while still maintaining the
                                benefits of traditional MRP applications. IFI found the combined
                                capabilities provided them unsurpassed flexibility.

                                In a traditional MRP environment, material replenishment is
                                based on a delicate balance of controlled inventory levels and
                                scheduled demands against that inventory. Naturally there are
                                considerable efforts and controls that are required to maintain
                                the integrity of the inventory and the accuracy of the demand
                                against it. These controls place a heavy burden on an
                                organization and are contrary to LEAN Manufacturing Practices.

                                In the LEAN World, the MRP system does not function and is not
                                required. The system generated replenishment reorder signal is
                                replaced with a visually triggered reorder signal based on
                                actual consumption of material. Although the organization is now
                                streamlined and operating efficiently, the burden is now placed
                                on the purchasing professionals to procure material from a
                                non-system based replenishment requirement.
