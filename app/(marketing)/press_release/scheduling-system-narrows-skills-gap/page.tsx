                                Technical Glass Products (TGP) has been using RMDB for years for finite capacity production scheduling. They selected RMDB because of how it could quickly adapt to their operational flow as well as its ability to integrate with their in-house systems. This facilitated a rapid implementation time along with all users quickly embracing the system. Recently, TGP noticed that their standards for task durations and resulting workcenter skill balancing had changed over time. They reached out to User Solutions to see how RMDB could be configured to include blending in new time studies, new product profiles, along with fluctuating workcenter capacities from a point in time moving forward, all the while preserving the actual tracking of schedule to date for historical analysis.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Leveraging RMDB's flexible configuration toolset, within only a few days of remote support, User Solutions was able to guide TGP through blending in new time studies with cross-trained skill demands, add that to their current production schedule and then run a variety of 'what-if' scenarios. This produced a realistic master production plan 6 months out, from which TGP confirmed their cross-training initiatives and rapidly redeployed current resources. By shaving off two weeks in lead time for deliverables, TGP was able to accommodate a 4% increase in business with the current workforce, while maintaining their customer service standard.

With only a couple of days of remote guidance from User Solutions, we greatly expanded RMDB's functionality to include defining cross-training initiatives and incorporate those results in a new production scheduling model that increased efficiencies. The result was our substantially increasing production capacity with existing resources. RMDB, along with our cross-trained workforce gives us a competitive advantage to quickly respond to new market conditions and business fluctuations without incurring additional expense."

That report, combined with the capacity utilization report, confirmed their cross-training initiatives and enables them to rapidly redeploy current resources to accommodate the increase in business. Since they incorporated the details of each workcenters' requirements directly into the schedule, it is easy for these cross-trained workers to move from one operation to the next without missing a beat."
