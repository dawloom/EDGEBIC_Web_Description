                                    MRP1 computes weekly net requirements for an inventory item
                                    for up to 20 weeks in the future. The model then schedules
                                    planned order releases and receipts to satisfy those
                                    requirements. Leadtimes can range from 0 to 6 weeks. MRP1 can
                                    handle a variety of practical complications in inventory
                                    planning, such as units previously allocated to specific
                                    future production runs, previously scheduled order receipts,
                                    lot sizing, safety stocks, and yields which are less than 100%
                                    of production quantities.

                                    MRP1 makes it easy to do a great deal of what-if analysis. A
                                    common problem in lot-sizing is that it frequently leads to
                                    carrying excess stock during periods of low demand. You can
                                    attempt to minimize excess stock by trying different lot
                                    sizes. If leadtimes are uncertain, you can add "safety
                                    leadtime" by trying larger leadtime values. If yields are
                                    uncertain, you can decrease the yield percentage. Another
                                    option is the POQ model in the next section.
