                                        Lean manufacturing is a systematic approach to minimizing
                                        waste within a manufacturing system while also maximizing
                                        productivity. It involves various techniques and
                                        methodologies that focus on continuous improvement, value
                                        stream mapping, and employee empowerment. At the core of
                                        lean is the pursuit of making every aspect of manufacturing
                                        as efficient, streamlined, and waste-free as possible.

                                        The five core principles of lean manufacturing include
                                        defining value, mapping the value stream, creating flow,
                                        establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Each principle

                                        processes. Understanding and applying these principles can
