                                was tasked with augmenting a maintenance schedule system both in
                                port and at sea for the power train of the aircraft carrier USS

                                outstanding. Both sets of tasks rely on common resources and I
                                needed an easy and reliable method to level load and schedule
                                according to priority and finite capacity, the never ending task

                                The maintenance and production for the four plants received data
                                from disparate, proprietary databases which, due to security
                                access restrictions, could not be combined or integrated.
                                Additionally, the schedule extended 2 years out to accommodate
                                dry dock cycles and the maintenance inventory had to accommodate
                                at-sea schedules averaging 4 to 10 months.

                                The disparate systems provided the preventative maintenance

                                maintenance tasks and resource requirements from another and
                                materials requirements from yet a third. Chris was trying to
                                schedule using 10 separate master Excel files. Microsoft Project
                                was an excellent tool for his Gantt charting but he was doing
                                far too much importing and exporting with so much disparate
                                information. Attempts with other project management systems
                                still left Chris without capacity considerations.

                                Bill-of-Resource (BOR) in RMX. RMX is designed to adapt to

                                needs only to input that BOR and the BOR backfills the master

                                calendar, resource calendar, forecast calendar and the vendor
                                list. Typical ERP systems require the user to start from a
                                product list from which a Bill-of-Material (BOM) is built and a
                                workcenter list from which a routing needs to be created. RMX's
                                backfill feature is a major contributor to not only fast
