                                        Ever wonder why, after picking what you thought was the
                                        shortest line, you&apos;re the last to get through? Or, why

                                        with no apparent reason? There are two mathematical

                                        Random events aren&apos;t predictable but also occur in
                                        clusters. Think about it. By definition, you can&apos;t
                                        predict a random event. &quot;They&quot; always say aircraft
                                        crashes happen in threes, or bad things happen together, but
                                        there is no other way. If we could predict an airplane crash
                                        we wouldn&apos;t fly on that day. The more familiar
                                        reference to random events is known as &apos;Murphys
                                        Law&apos; â€” anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

                                        If the event is not deterministic, or predictable, then it
                                        will not fall within a known interval of time. Therefore,
                                        some intervals between events will be longer, some shorter.
                                        The shorter intervals are referred to as
                                        &apos;clusters&apos;.
