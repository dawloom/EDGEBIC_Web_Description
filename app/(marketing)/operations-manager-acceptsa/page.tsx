                                    Acceptance sampling is a procedure for screening lots of
                                    incoming material. We decide whether to accept or reject the
                                    entire lot based on the results of a sample. A sampling plan
                                    is defined by two parameters: sample size and acceptance
                                    number. The acceptance number is the maximum number of
                                    allowable defects in the sample. If the sample contains this
                                    number or fewer defects, the lot is accepted without further
                                    inspection. If the sample contains more than the maximum
                                    number of defects, the lot is rejected and a 100% inspection
                                    is conducted.

                                    The sample size and acceptance number determine the risks
                                    faced by the producer and consumer of the lot. The producer's
                                    risk is the probability that a "good" lot will be rejected by
                                    the sampling process. Lots are defined as good if they contain
                                    no more than a certain level of defectives called the
                                    acceptable quality level (AQL). The consumer's risk is the
                                    probability that a "bad" lot will be accepted. Lots are called
                                    bad if they contain more than a certain level of defectives
                                    called the lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD). Using the
                                    binomial distribution, the ACCEPTSA worksheet computes the
                                    producer's and consumer's risks, given the lot size, sample
                                    size, acceptance number, AQL, and LTPD.
