                                We were looking for a way to schedule three in-line departments
                                and various machines. Scheduling was being completed by the
                                respective department supervisors with no commonality between
                                them. My major concern was being able to preprogram alternate
                                routes for certain part numbers to achieve the most flexibility
                                throughout all departments. With the guidance of User Solutions,
                                we were able to solve that problem easily as well as create one
                                common computerized production schedule that could be understood
                                by all departments involved. All this was done using data that
                                was already in an Excel format, which made implementation a
                                snap.
