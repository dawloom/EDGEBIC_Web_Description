                                        Regular seasonal patterns appear in most business data. The
                                        weather affects the sales of everything from bikinis to
                                        snowmobiles. Around holiday periods, we see increases in the
                                        number of retail sales, long-distance telephone calls, and
                                        gasoline consumption. Business policy can cause seasonal
                                        patterns in sales. Many companies run annual dealer
                                        promotions which cause peaks in sales. Other companies
                                        depress sales temporarily by shutting down plants for annual
                                        vacation periods.

                                        Usually seasonality is obvious but there are times when it
                                        is not. Two questions should be asked when there is doubt
                                        about seasonality. First, are the peaks and troughs
                                        consistent? That is, do the high and low points of the
                                        pattern occur in about the same periods (week, month, or
                                        quarter) each year? Second, is there an explanation for the
                                        seasonal pattern? The most common reasons for seasonality
                                        are weather and holidays, although company policy such as
                                        annual sales promotions may be a factor. If the answer to
                                        either of these questions is no, seasonality should not be
                                        used in the forecasts.

                                        Our approach to forecasting seasonal data is based on the
                                        classical decomposition method developed by economists in
                                        the nineteenth century. Decomposition means separation of
                                        the time series into its component parts. A complete
                                        decomposition separates the time series into four
                                        components: seasonality, trend, cycle, and randomness. The
                                        cycle is a long-range pattern related to the growth and
                                        decline of industries or the economy as a whole.

                                        Two worksheets are available for seasonal adjustment.
                                        MULTIMON uses the ratio-to-moving average method to adjust
                                        monthly data. ADDITMON uses a similar method called the
                                        difference-to-moving average method to adjust monthly data.
                                        It may be necessary to test both of these worksheets before
                                        choosing a seasonal pattern.
